Simulation Disease Spreadâ€‹
Step 1. Input an integer perfect square

Step 2. Input an integer how many times you would want the simulation to be ran

Step 3. Input the probability of getting the infecton (those who are susceptible will have those odds ran)

Code outputs the array after each cycle, those who are near a person who is infected will then become susceptible and have odds ran to see if they become infected.
It also outputs how many cycles it has gone through after each cycle

Not implemented: Recovery + how many people are infected per cycle
